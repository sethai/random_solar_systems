# Solar System Generator

This is a random solar system generator.
It's based on the generator made by [Eric Davidson](https://github.com/erdavids).

In his [Generative-Space-System](https://github.com/erdavids/Generative-Space-System) repository he used pycairo and python 2.7 to generate random solar system images.

As I use Windows and couldn't easy install pycairo I just decided to switch to pygame (and learn pygame instead of pycairo :) ).

This is the result.

## TODO list:

- [x] Rewrite the base script using pygame
- [x] Make orbit lines the color of planets
- [ ] Add random Asteroid belt
- [ ] Make Asteroid shapes random
- [ ] Add moons to planets
- [ ] Add title to the image
- [ ] Generate centered solar system (sun in the middle of image)
- [ ] Generate centered solar system with random position of planets on orbits
- [ ] Add vector graphics and export as svg
- [ ] Add texture for the image
- [ ] Random texture on planets (not plain color)
- [x] Different color sets for sun / planets
